player(String ID, String username, String email, int max_score, int coins)
ID and username could be unified (no repeated username)

max_scores(player_ID) (Always sorted)
when finishing a run:
	Check if score is higher than highest score
	If so, update in player
		Check in max_scores if the score is higher than the minimum max score
		If so, delete minimum score entry and add new score entry
			Sort max_scores

achivements(String player_ID, bool ach1, bool ach2, ..., bool achn)
	May not be the optimal option

characters(String player_ID, bool char1, bool char2, ..., bool charn)

stats(String username, int max_score, int coins, int jumps, int enemies_killed, int total_runs, ...)
